Reflection:

During this exercise, I encountered several challenges, the most significant being understanding the problem and translating it into code. Specifically, I found it challenging to differentiate between the various phone plan packages and accurately represent the calculations needed for each in the code. Each package had different thresholds for included GB and additional charges, which required me to carefully track these variations and implement the necessary calculations. Writing the code to handle these different scenarios, especially when considering conditions like the application of coupons, required a thorough understanding of the problem and careful planning.

I followed the first three rules of programming which is keeping the code minimal, ensuring it outputs the desired result, and following the algorithm. I aimed to write as few lines as possible to maintain clarity and simplicity while still achieving the intended functionality. By closely following the outlined algorithm, I ensured that my solution was logically structured and aligned with the problem requirements. When I encountered difficulties in differentiating between the packages, I tried to focus on understanding what made each package unique, such as the threshold for included GB and the rate for additional data. I then used these insights to develop the formulas and conditions that would provide the correct output. Adding comments throughout the code also helped me keep track of my progress and identify missing elements in my solution.

Ultimately, this exercise increased my excitement about Python's potential and what I can achieve through coding. Understanding how to break down complex problems and implement them in a structured manner is becoming more intuitive, which is encouraging. Working with my partner was also beneficial; their strong grasp of test cases and equations helped clarify how the different calculations should be applied to each package. This collaborative aspect not only reinforced my understanding but also made the process more efficient. Overall, I believe I have learned what I was meant to learn from this labâ€”gaining a deeper understanding of Python and becoming more confident in tackling real-world coding challenges.

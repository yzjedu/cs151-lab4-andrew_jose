In this lab my partner and I were supposed to get practice with string methods and formatting, decision making, and using loops.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, our group followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an algorithm, peer reviewing those, test cases, and then developing our code. We used each other as peer reviewers as a technique to solve any difficulties we had or errors.
Key concepts explored were using while loops, math module and Booleans, as well as developing flowcharts.

Our group’s results did match what we expected. Because we heavily designed our program through our algorithm, it was easier to do our code and get the results we expected. Our group also developed multiple test cases, which helped us make sure our code worked well.

The challenges we encountered were developing our algorithm. Our group had not previously developed an algorithm so complex, so it was difficult at first, but with professor’s help and feedback I believe it ended well. I think my key takeaways from this lab was the incorporating while loops, and how they can help take your code to the next level and help out a lot. I do believe our group ended up learning what we were supposed to from this lab. It was nice working with a partner that way we could split the workload and give each other ideas.
